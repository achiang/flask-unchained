This tutorial will walk you through creating a basic blog application called Flaskr Unchained. Users will be able to register, log in, create posts, and edit or delete their own posts. You will be able to package and install the application on other computers.

It's assumed you're already familiar with Python. The `official tutorial <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/>`_ in the Python docs is a great way to learn or review first.

**FIXME: The tutorial project code is available on GitHub.**
