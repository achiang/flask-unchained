# Flask Unchained

## The better way to build large Flask applications.

Flask Unchained is an extension that implements the Application Factory Pattern. It provides a standardized (by convention) way to organize "bundles" of code, such that they become easily distributable, reusable, and customizable across multiple independent Flask Unchained projects (similar to Django's "apps", with an architecture inspired by [Symfony](https://symfony.com/)). The ultimate goal is to provide a fully integrated, optional-batteries-included web application framework built on top of Flask.

* dependency injection of services and extensions
* a REST API framework, integrated with Marshmallow and SQLAlchemy
   - work-in-progress support for [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) (aka Swagger) docs, using [ReDoc](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc) as the frontend (internally, it uses the [APISpec](http://apispec.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library)
* automatic discovery and registration of:
   - Configuration
   - Controllers, Resources, and Views
   - Services and Extensions
   - Click groups and commands
   - SQLAlchemy database models
   - Marshmallow serializers
   - Flask-Admin admin classes
   - Celery tasks
* much simplified customization of third-party code

## Quickstart

```bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
$ cookiecutter gh:briancappello/cookiecutter-flask-unchained

# (answer the questions and `cd` into the new directory)
# (create a virtualenv using your tool of choice)
$ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
$ flask run
```

## What does it look like?

A minimal Hello World application structure looks like this:

```
/home/user/dev/project-root
├── app
│   ├── templates
│   │   └── site
│   │       └── index.html
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── config.py
│   ├── routes.py
│   └── views.py
└── unchained_config.py
```

A larger application structure might look like this:

```
/home/user/dev/project-root
├── app                 # your app bundle package
│   ├── admins          # model admins
│   ├── commands        # Click groups/commands
│   ├── extensions      # Flask extensions
│   ├── models          # SQLAlchemy models
│   ├── serializers     # Marshmallow serializers (aka schemas)
│   ├── services        # dependency-injectable services
│   ├── tasks           # Celery tasks
│   ├── templates       # Jinja2 templates
│   ├── views           # Controllers and Resources
│   └── __init__.py
│   └── config.py       # app config
│   └── routes.py       # declarative routes
├── assets              # static assets to be handled by Webpack
│   ├── images
│   ├── scripts
│   └── styles
├── bundles             # third-party bundle extensions/overrides
│   └── security        # a customized/extended Flask Security Bundle
│       ├── models
│       ├── serializers
│       ├── services
│       ├── templates
│       └── __init__.py
├── db
│   ├── fixtures        # SQLAlchemy model fixtures (for seeding the dev db)
│   └── migrations      # Alembic migrations (generated by Flask-Migrate)
├── static              # static assets (Webpack compiles to here, and Flask
│                       #  serves this folder at /static (by default))
├── templates           # the top-level templates folder
├── tests               # your pytest tests
├── webpack             # Webpack configs
└── unchained_config.py # the flask unchained config
```

To learn how to build such a larger example application, check out the [official tutorial](https://flask-unchained.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html).

Going back to the minimal hello world app, the code is as follows:

The first step is to create an app bundle module in your project root, we'll call ours `app`, with an `AppBundle` subclass in it:

```python
# project-root/app/__init__.py

from flask_unchained import AppBundle


class App(AppBundle):
    pass
```

Add the minimal required configuration:

```python
# project-root/app/config.py

import os

from flask_unchained import AppConfig


class Config(AppConfig):
    SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('FLASK_SECRET_KEY', 'change-me-to-a-secret-key')
```

And a hello world view along with its template:

```python
# project-root/app/views.py

from flask_unchained import Controller, route


class SiteController(Controller):
    @route('/')
    def index(self):
        return self.render('index')
```

```html
<!-- project-root/app/templates/site/index.html -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hello World from Flask Unchained!</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World from Flask Unchained!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

Now we can register the controller with our `routes`:

```python
# project-root/app/routes.py

from flask_unchained import (include, prefix, controller, resource, func, 
                             get, post, patch, put, rule)

from .views import SiteController


routes = lambda: [
    controller(SiteController),
]
```

Enable the bundle in `unchained_config.py`:

```python
# project-root/unchained_config.py

BUNDLES = [
    'app',
]
```

And run it:

```bash
$ flask run
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Now you should be able to browse to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view your new site!
